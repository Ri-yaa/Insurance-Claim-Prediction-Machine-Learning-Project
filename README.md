**Insurance Claim Prediction using Machine Learning** aims to build models that can predict whether a customer is likely to make an insurance claim based on historical data and customer profiles. By analyzing factors such as age, vehicle type, driving history, medical background, and previous claims, machine learning algorithms can identify hidden patterns and provide accurate predictions. This helps insurance companies reduce risks, detect fraud, and optimize premium pricing, while also improving customer experience by offering personalized policies.
